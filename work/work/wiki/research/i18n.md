# Internationalization and localization

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In computing, **internationalization and localization** are means of adapting computer software to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market.
Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can potentially be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalization software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translation text. Localization(which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization(which is ideally performed only once, or as an integral part of ongoing development).

## Naming

The terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms **i18n**(where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first *i* and last *n* in *internationalization*, a usage coined at DEC in the 1970s or 80s) and **L10n** respectively, due to the length of the words.

Some companies, like IBM and Sun Microsystems, use the item "globalization" for the combination of internationalization and localization. Also known as "glocalization"(a portmanteau of globalization and localization).

Microsoft defines Internationalization as a combination of World-Readiness and localization. World-Readiness is a developer task, which enables a product to be used with multiple scripts and cultures(globalization) and separating user interface resources in a localizable format(localizability, abbreviated to L12y).

This concept is also known as **NLS**(**National Language Support** or **Native Language Support**).

## Scope

The main task of language localization is translation. This may involve:
  - For film, video, and audio, translation of spoken words or music lyrics, often using either dubbing or subtitles
  - Text translation for printed materials, digital media(possibly including error messages and documentation)
  - Potentially altering images and logos containing text to contain translations or generic icons
  - Different translation length and differences in character size(e.g. between Latin alphabet letters and Chinese characters) can cause layouts that work well in one language to work poorly in others
  - Consideration of differences in dialect, register or variety
  - Writing conventions like:
    - Formatting of numbers(especially decimal separator and digit grouping)
    - Date and time format, possibly including use of different calendars

Computer software can encounter differences above and beyond straightforward translation of words and phrases, because computer programs can generate content dynamically. These differences may need to be taken into account by the internationalization process in preparation for translation. Examples include:
  - Different "scripts" in different writing systems use different characters - a different set of letters, syllograms, logograms, or symbols. Modern system use the Unicode standard to represent many different languages with a single character encoding
  - Writing direction is left to right in most European languages(e.g. German), right to left in Hebrew and Arabic, and optionally vertical in some Asian languages
  - Complex text layout, for languages where characters change shape depending on context
  - Capitalization exists in some scripts and not in others
  - Different languages and writing systems have different text sorting rules
  - Different languages have different numeral systems, which might need to be supported if Western Arabic numerals are not used
  - Different languages have different pluralization rules, which can complicate programs that dynamically display numerical content. Other grammar rules might also vary, e.g. genitive
  - Different languages use different punctuation(e.g. quoting text using double-quotes(""), as in English, or quillemets(« »), as in French)
  - Keyboard shortcuts can only make use of buttons actually on the keyboard layout which is being localized for. If a shortcut corresponds to a word in a particular language(e.g. Ctrl-s stands for "save" in English), it may need to be changed

Different countries have different economic conventions, including variations in:
  - Paper sizes
  - Broadcast television systems and popular storage media
  - Telephone number format
  - Postal address format, postal codes, and choice of delivery services
  - Currency(symbols, positions of currency markers, and reasonable amounts due to different inflation history) - ISO 4217 codes are often used for internationalization
  - System of measurement
  - Battery sizes
  - Voltage and current standards

Specific third-party services, such as online maps, weather reports, or payment service providers, might not be available worldwide from the same carriers, or at all.

Time zones vary across the world, and this must be taken into account if a product originally only interacted with people in a single time zone. For internationalization, UTC is often used internally and then converted into a local time zone for display purposes.

Different countries have different governments, meaning:
  - Regulatory compliance may require customization for a particular jurisdiction, or a change to the product as a whole, such as:
    - Privacy law compliance
    - Additional disclaimers on a web site or packaging
    - Different consumer labelling requirements
    - Compliance with export restrictions and regulations on encryption
    - Compliance with an Internet censorship regime or suboena procedures
    - Requirements for accessibility
    - Collecting different taxes, such as sales tax, value added tax, or customs duties
    - Sensitivity to different political issues, like geographical naming disputes and disputed borders shown on maps(e.g. failing to show Kashmir as Indian is a crime in India)
  - Government assigned numbers have different formats(such as passports, the Social Security number in the US, National Insurance number in the UK, Isikukood in Estonia, and Resident registration number in South Korea)

Localization also may take into account differences in culture, such as:
  - Local holidays
  - Personal name and title conventions
  - Aesthetics
  - Comprehensibility and cultural appropriateness of images and color symbolism
  - Ethnicity, clothing, and socioeconomic status of people and architecture of locations pictured
  - Local customs and conventions, such as social taboos, popular local religions, or superstitions such as blood types in Japanese culture vs. astrological sign in other cultures
