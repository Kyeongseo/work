**[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/)** is a free and open-source cloud computing software platform. Users primarily deploy it as an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solution. The technology consists of a series of interrelated projects that control pools of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center-which users manage through a web-based dashboard, command-line tools, or a RESTfulAPI. OpenStack.org released it under the terms of the Apache License.
