- 'use strict'
 - Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken(실행) and throws more exceptions.
  - It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
  - It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
  - It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.
