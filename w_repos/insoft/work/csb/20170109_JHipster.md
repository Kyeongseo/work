#### MODERN WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT

- Modern web apps
	- we need robust, scalable high-performance servers.
		- beautiful design (Front-End)
		- stop waiting for pages to load
		- dynamic updates of page fragments
		- should be able to handle huge numbers of concurrent users
		- all using massive RESTful application, which will hit your back-end servers hard (robust and high-quality Back-End)
- Client-side technologies
	- Yeoman, Gulp, Bower, AngularJS, Bootstrap

#### JHipster = generator

- ```Spring Boot``` + ```AngularJS``` application generator
- JHipster is a ```Yeoman``` generator, used to create a Spring Boot + AngularJS project.
	- high-performance and robust Java stack on the server side with __Spring Boot__
	- sleek, modern, mobile first front-end with __AngularJS__ and Bootstrap
	- powerful workflow to build your application with __Yeoman__, Bower(npm), Gulp(grunt) and Maven

---
#### Technology stack

##### client side


- Yeoman
	- Yeoman provides application generators
		- mostly geared toward JavaScript front-end applications
		- yo jhipster
	- generic scaffolding(디렉터리 구조처럼 틀을 만들어 주는것) system allowing the creation of any kind of app.
	- it allows for rapidly getting started on new projects and streamlines the maintenance of existing projects.

- Bower (~./bowerrc)
	- Bower is a package manager for your JavaScript assets
		- provides a huge number of libraries and search, install and update your JavaScript libraries
		- bower install angular
	- to install and update JavaScript, CSS and Sass dependencies.
	- a package manager for the web
	- the package manager is used for dependency management.
	- web sites are make of lots of things - frameworks, libraries, assets, and utilities. Bower manages all these things for you.
	- 플러그인을 관리하는 패키지 관리자.

- Gulp
	- Gulp is a JavaScript task runner
		- for development, it will allow you to have "live editing" of your code, run your tests in the background
		- for production, it will compress and optimize all your resources, compile your Sass code
		- gulp test
	- client-side live reload

- Karma
	- Karma runs unit tests on your JavaScript code

- AngularJS
	- the most popular javascript framework

- Twitter Bootstrap
	- great CSS/ Javascript framework for responsive web apps


##### server side

- Maven | Gradle (~/.m2/settings.xml, .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties)
	- the most popular java build tools
		- well-known, pre-definded directories and goals.
		- Integration with major IDEs
		- great plugin ecosystem, including Spring Boot and Yeoman
	- mvnw -Pprod (use the pre-configured "prod" Maven profile)
	- mvnw -Pprod package (package the application as a "production" WAR)

- Spring Boot
	- Spring is the de-facto standard for JAVA apps
		- IoC, AoP and abstractions to ease application coding
		- fast and light weight, and extreamely powerful when needed
		- out of the box configuration by Spring Boot
		- live reload of application

- Netflix OSS
	- netflix oss provides great tools and frameworks for micoservices.

- Liquibase
	- database updates made easy
		- handles updating a database schema
		- works great with spring and JPA
		- needs a good understanding of databases and ORM

- JPA (Java Persistence API)
	- the standard ORM solution for java
		- hibernate is used underneath
		- very complete, impressive set of features
		- still complex to understand for newbies

- JDL(JHipster Domain Language)
	- JDL is a JHipster specific domain language 
	- yo jhipster:improt-jdl jhipster-jdl.jh
	- JDL-Studio
		- online IDE to create JDL and its UML visualization.
		- online tool to create entities and relationships using our domain-specific language.
		- a tool for drawing JHipster JDL diagrams based on the JDL syntax.
	- yo jhipster:import-jdl your-jdl-file.jh

- Spring Data JPA
	- adds extra syntaxic sugar on top of JPA
		- generate your JPA repositories automatically
		- removes a lot of boilerplate code

- MongoDB
	- noSql for scalability

- Cassandra
	- noSql for scalability

- Caching
	- caching is king for performance
	- Ehcache is the most widely used solution
	- HazelCast is a great alternative, with clustering support
	- Hibernate 2nd level cache or Spring Caching abstraction

- Spring Security
	- bulletproof security frmaework
		- secures URLs and Java code(Spring Beans)
		- Works both with stateful(cookies) and stateless(OAuth2/JWT) Web application architectures

- Spring MVC REST
	- the best rest frmaework in JAVA

- Thymeleaf
	- server side templates
		- replaces JSPs and JSTLs,with are outdate

- Monitoring
	- ready for production with metrics

- Cloud deployment
	- to the cloud and beyound
		- leading cloud providers like cloud foundry, heroku and amazon web service all provide specific tooling and deplyment options.

---

- Monolithic architecture uses a single, one-size-fits-all application, which contains both the front-end AngularJS code, and the back-end Spring Boot code.

- Microservices architecture splits the front-end and back-end, so that it's easier for yout application to scale and survive infrastructure issues.

- websocket are useful for having a very dynamic application, where data is shared in near real-time between the server and its clients.

- Test
	- gatling
		- performance tests with gatiling
	- cucumber
		- behaviour-driven tests with cucumber
	- protractor
		- angularJS integration tests with protractor

- SonarQube (Code quality)
- Jenkins (Continuous Integration)
