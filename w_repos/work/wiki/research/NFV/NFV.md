# Network Functions Virtualization

from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Network Functions Virtualization**(NFV) is a network architecture concept that processing using IT virtualization related technologies to virtualize entire classes of network node functions into building blocks that may be connected, or chained, to create communication services.

NFV relies upon, but differs from, traditional server virtualization techniques such as those used in enterprise IT. A virtualized network function, or VNF, may consist of one or more virtual machines running different software and processes, on top of industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage, or even cloud computing infrastructure, instead of having custom hardware appliances for each network function.

For example, a virtualized session border controller function could be deployed to protect a network without the typical cost and complexity of obtaining and installing physical units. Other examples of NFV include virtualized load balancers, firewalls, intrusion detection devices and WAN accelerators.

## Background
Product development within the telecommunications industry has traditionally followed rigorous standards for stability, protocol adherence and quality. While this model worked well in the past, it inevitably led to long product cycles, a slow pace of development and reliance on proprietary or specialist hardware. The rise of significant competition in communications services, from fast-moving organizations operating at large scale on the public Internet(such as Google Talk), have spurred service providers to look for ways to disrupt the status quo.

## History
In October 2012, an industry specifications group, "Network Functions Virtualization", published a white paper at a conference in Darmstadt, Germany on software-defined networking and OpenFlow. The group, part of th European Telecommunications Standards Institute(ETSI), was made up of representatives from the telecommunications industry from both Europe and beyond.

Since the publication of the white paper, the group has produced several more in-depth materials, including a standard terminology definition and use cases for NFV that act as references for vendors and operators considering implementing NFV.
